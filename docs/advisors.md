## How to find your advisor

You can find the contact information for your academic advisor on the [Dornsife website](https://dornsife.usc.edu/humanities-majors/).

## What you can expect from your advisor

These are things that you can expect your advisor to help you with:

1. Lift your registration hold to register for courses.
2. Mediate conflict between you and your professors.
3. Discuss your academic goals.

## What you can do on your own

Each academic advisor has many, many students. It is recommended that you take initiative and prepare for your appointments with your advisor because you are ultimately responsible for your own academic success. These are things that you can do on your own before or after meeting with your advisor:

1. Think about which courses you need to take.
2. Think about which courses you want to take.
3. Talk to your professors about which courses to take.
4. Think about which minors or majors you want to add.
5. Get D-Clearance for the courses you want to take by contacting the department directly.
