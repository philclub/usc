The long-term career opportunities for philosophy majors are almost limitless. Philosophy majors tend to have excellent critical-thinking, writing, and communication skills, and these skills usually help them excel at their chosen career, even if these careers are unrelated to philosophy. For some inspiration on what you can do with a philosophy degree, see the American Philosophical Association's page titled, ["Who studies philosophy?"](https://www.apaonline.org/page/whostudiesphilosophy) or take a look at their [poster](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/diversity/Who_Studies_Philosophy_Poste.pdf).

However, some people have personal restrictions that restrict the employment opportunities that they are likely to be happy with accepting. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, a desire to live in a specific city, work in a particular industry, earn a certain salary, or perform a specific job function. If they only have a bachelor's degree in philosophy, it can be difficult for them to find employment opportunities that satisfy these restrictions. Therefore, if you are looking for the _maximum flexibility_ in employment opportunities _immediately after graduating_, it is recommended that you pursue a double major or minor in another discipline, develop additional skills, acquire additional domain knowledge, and make connections with people outside of philosophy.

It is important for you to be realistic about which employment opportunities you are likely to be happy with immediately after college and research whether and how a philosophy degree will prepare you for it. There are many roles (e.g., software engineer) for which the skills that you obtain from doing philosophy can help you excel in long-term but are insufficient for you to easily obtain immediately after graduating, so you should probably prepare accordingly based on your research.
