The career opportunities for philosophy majors with no other skills besides philosophy are quite limited. However, philosophy majors tend to have excellent writing and communication skills, and these usually help them excel at their chosen career. To find high-paying, meaningful employment as a philosophy major, you will probably need to pursue graduate or professional education, develop additional skills, acquire domain knowledge outside philosophy, and make connections with people outside philosophy. Unless you are committed to pursue graduate or professional education, it is recommended that you pursue a double major or minor in another discipline.
