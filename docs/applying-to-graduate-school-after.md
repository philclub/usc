## Introduction

Most, if not all institutions should eventually notify you with the outcome of your application by early to mid Spring. Unfortunately, different admission committees work at a different pace, and they seem to be on very different timelines. One constraint across institutions is the national deadline for accepted offers, which is April 15. Students must accept or decline by their offers by then in order to be fully admitted into the program. But while some graduate programs issue their offers of admission sometime in January or February, others wait until late March. At USC, we generally make an effort to notify all applicants by late February at the latest, but the timeline depends on what dates turn out to be available for admissions committee to meet through the different stages of the process.

## If you are offered admission to a program

If you are offered admission to a national program subject to the April 15 deadline, it may be helpful to take your time to consider your options. This is, after all, a very significant milestone, and you should take the time to consider what may be best for you and to make an informed decision. Some programs may organize an Open House and they may invite you to visit the department. This is an important visit, since you will be able to have a better sense of what life in the department may be like and it will provide you with a unique opportunity to talk to faculty and graduate students there. These visits will be a particularly helpful source of information if you are admitted to more than one program and want to be able to make an effective comparison between them.

## If you are waitlisted for admission to a program

If you are waitlisted for admission, you may hear so from the admissions committee. Different programs may have different procedures, but if you are notified, it is very important to remain in close touch with the point person at that committee. They will let you know if there are any significant developments for your case, and it helps if you notify them of any significant developments on your end.
