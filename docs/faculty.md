Professors are usually very happy to help students, and it is part of their job to do so. You do not need to be their student to ask for help, but try to be respectful of their time. You can find a roster of the faculty at the USC School of Philosophy and their emails on the [Dornsife website](https://dornsifelive.usc.edu/cf/phil/phil_faculty_roster.cfm).
