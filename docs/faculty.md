Professors are usually very happy to help students, and it is part of their job to do so. You do not need to be their student to ask for help, but try to be respectful of their time. You can find a roster of the faculty at the USC School of Philosophy and their emails on the [Dornsife website](https://dornsifelive.usc.edu/cf/phil/phil_faculty_roster.cfm).

## Ranks

Each faculty member at the USC School of Philosohy has their own rank. These are some common ranks, from lowest to highest:

1. Adjunct Professor
2. Lecturer
3. Assistant Professor
4. Associate Professor
5. Professor (or "Full" Professor)
6. Endowed Chair Professor
7. Distinguished Professor
8. University Professor
9. Professor Emeritus

Most professors at the USC School of Philosophy have the rank Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or (Full) Professor. Each increase in rank is usually associated with an increase in status, salary, administrative responsibilities, and paperwork. The exception to this trend is Professor Emeritus. These professors are mostly retired but keep the Professor status because they were extremely accomplished during their careers.

Associate Professors and Professors have **tenure** status, which means that they tend to have high job security and cannot be fired except by participating in illegal activities or committing severe grievances such as discrimination or sexual harassment as described in the [faculty handbook](https://policy.usc.edu/faculty/faculty-handbook/).

Assistant Professors are usually **tenure-track** faculty. If an Assistant Professor fulfills their research obligations, then they will likely be promoted to Associate rank. They usually need to write 12 papers on topics distinct from their doctoral dissertation that are either published or on track to publish in respectable academic journals. They may also write a book for an academic publisher. Assistant Professors usually have two 3-year periods to accomplish these works, but their employment may be terminated after the first period if they are not productive enough. Some Assistant Professors may be promoted in fewer than 6 years if they produce enough works before their 6-year contract is over. If an Assistant Professor fails to be promoted to Associate, then they will need to find employment elsewhere.

Because Assistant Professors are actively performing research, they may have less time to dedicate to students who are not in their courses. Associate Professors and Full Professors usually advise graduate students on their research and have more experience with teaching.
