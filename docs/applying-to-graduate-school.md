The following guide is derived from _Applying to graduate school in philosophy_ by Professor Gabriel Uzquiano, Director of Graduate Studies at the USC School of Philosophy. You can find a copy of the original guide [here](/applying-to-graduate-school-in-philosophy.pdf).

## Introduction

Your application will be read by multiple members of the admissions committee in the first rounds of assessment, and all members of the committee will look at applications that reach the last stage of evaluation. Readers, however, will make a global assessment of the file, which means that no one aspect of the file will generally rule the application in –– or out –– of contention. Having said that, it makes sense to pay special attention to aspects of the applications that are under your direct control such as your personal statement and your writing sample. What follows are some comments on some aspects of a typical application for graduate school in philosophy.

## Biogrpahic information and contact details

Make sure you use the same contact details in all the documents you submit. It is helpful, in particular, to list the same email address and phone number in your CV as you do in other parts of the application. Your e-mail address will eventually be used in order to contact you with the outcome of your application.

## Academic records

You should submit transcripts of each of your previous academic institutions. Some institutions, USC, for example, require official copies of your transcripts to be mailed directly from your institution in order to eventually process enrollment. Your academic record plays in the overall assessment of the application, but will generally not, by itself, rule it in –– or out ––of contention.

## GRE

The GRE is one more piece of information for admissions committees to consider, though it is generally not as central as some of the others listed below. This is one aspect of the application that can be offset by some of your other application materials.

## Personal statement

Your personal statement is one of the most important aspects of your application. It is an opportunity to introduce yourself and to showcase your sense of purpose and commitment to philosophy.

- Present your main research interests in philosophy and explain how they connect to broader areas of research in the department.

- In order to write an effective personal statement, you may want to look at the research interests of the faculty and graduate students in the program to check whether––and how––they fit your own interests. It may help if you are able to explain how you take the graduate program to fit your research interests and goals.

- Be brief, generally no more than one or two pages, but use the space to make clear you have a sense of purpose and have carefully considered the question of mutual fit with the department.

## Writing sample

If the personal statement showcases your sense of purpose and commitment to the subject, the writing sample provides evidence of research ability in philosophy. This is another crucial aspect of your application, and you should pay special attention to it. Different graduate programs may have different length requirements but USC, for example, suggests a length between 12 and 20 pages.

- Choose a sample that represents your best work to date and is, to some extent, connected to your primary research interests.

- Make sure to make it accessible to non-specialists in the area. Remember that your application will be considered by multiple members of the admissions committee and they may come with very different backgrounds and research interests. The sample should be a self-contained piece that someone without a specialization int he area is able to profitably read.

- Ask for feedback from your faculty member –– or members. This may even help inform their letter, since, they may perhaps want to comment on the sample and how it is connected to your broader research interests and goals as well as illustrate your research abilities and potential in philosophy.

## Letters of reference

Letters of reference play a significant role in the admissions process, which means it is important to do as much as you can to help your letter writers write effective letters of support.

- If you can, ask someone who knows both you and your work well. It may help if they have had extended interactions with you –– as an instructor in one of the lecture courses you have taken or as an advisor or an independent research course –– and if they are familiar with some aspect of your philosophical work.

- The best letters tend to be the most informative ones; they are able to speak in some detail to your strength and research potential and they may even mention some of the work they have seen from you. For letter writers to be in a position to write an informed letter, they should have access to information. It helps if you can provide your letter writers with your CV and academic record as well as a list of schools to which you plan to apply.

- Most institutions will nowadays contact letter writers by email to request tht they upload their letter. You will often be notified once they do. Make sure to keep an eye on this to make sure your letter writers submit their letters prior to the application deadline.
