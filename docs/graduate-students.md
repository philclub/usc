Graduate students (teaching assistants, or TAs) at USC are great people to ask for more information about philosophy and the experience of graduate school in philosophy. They are, however, usually busy with their own courses and research, so try to be mindful of that and respect their time. You can find a roster of the graduate students in philosophy on the [Dornsife website](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/phil/phil_student_roster.cfm).
