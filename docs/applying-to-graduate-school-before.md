:::note
The following guide is derived from _Applying to graduate school in philosophy_ by Professor Gabriel Uzquiano, Director of Graduate Studies at the USC School of Philosophy. You can find a copy of the original guide [here](/applying-to-graduate-school-in-philosophy.pdf).
:::

1. Find a faculty mentor (or mentors) to help you with your search.

1. Do some research to figure out which graduate programs in philosophy are the best fit for you given your philosophical interests, goals, and personal circumstances. You may have heard of the [Philosophical Gourmet](https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/) Report and the [APA Guide to Graduate Programs in Philosophy](https://www.apaonline.org/general/custom.asp?page=gradguide). However, it is important to research specific graduate programs to gauge the extent to which they may match - or not - your initial research interests, goals, and personal circumstances. Departmental websites generally include specific information on the structure of the graduate program and its placement record as well as links to individual pages by faculty and graduate students. These can give you a sense of a variety of research interests of people in the department. For an overview of the graduate program at USC, you may consult the [Graduate Program page](https://dornsifelive.usc.edu/phil/our-graduate-program/).

1. Remember to ask for letters of support as early as you can. The sooner you ask the more time you give letter writers to compose a detail and informed letter. A last minute request may lead to a brief, generic letter, which, though supportive, may not be informative enough to make your application stand out and bolster your case.

1. Make sure to research the deadlines for the graduate programs to which you want to apply. The deadline for USC is December 31, but other deadlines range from late Fall to early Spring.

1. Graduate admission is a centralized process in some institutions. At USC, for example, graduate admission is conducted by a central [Office of Graduate Admissions](https://gradadm.usc.edu/) in conjunction with each graduate program. This office would be the first step for a variety of practical questions to do with documentation, transcripts, language requirements, testing requirements, etc. At USC, you will find additional information in the [Apply section ](https://dornsifelive.usc.edu/phil/apply/) of the departmental website.
