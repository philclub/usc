## Logic

Formal logic is very important for long-term success in academic philosophy. Many professors, such as Prof. Shieva Kleinschmit, Director of Undergraduate Studies, [recommend](./guides.md) taking logic courses as soon as you can, preferably this semester or next semester. Get started on your own with propositional and predicate logic at [USC Logic Web](https://dornsife.usc.edu/USCLogicWeb).

## Sharing your work

We recommend that you learn how to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and programming languages for web development ([HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)). These skills are not required to succeed in philosophy, but they are helpful for sharing your work with other people on the internet. You can find tutorials on LaTeX on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) and video lectures on web development on [LinkedIn Learning](https://itservices.usc.edu/linkedin-learning/) (free for USC students).
