If an Assistant Professor fulfills their research obligations, then they will likely be promoted to Associate rank. They usually need to write 12 papers on topics distinct from their doctoral dissertation that are either published or on track to publish in respectable academic journals. They may also write a book for an academic publisher. Assistant Professors usually have two 3-year periods to accomplish these works, but their employment may be terminated after the first period if they are not productive enough. Some Assistant Professors may be promoted in fewer than 6 years if they produce enough works before their 6-year contract is over. If an Assistant Professor fails to be promoted to Associate, then they will need to find employment elsewhere."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
